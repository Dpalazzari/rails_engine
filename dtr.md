  ## Member Names: **Drew Palazzari & Mike Schutte**

**When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?**

  * Designated work time, 7:30 - 5 Tuesday through Thursday. Monday til 8pm. Paired as much as possible.

**What does each group member hope to get out of the project?**

  * Drew: Become API master, 3's and 4's, solid testing. Get better with active record.
  * Mike: Learn from Drew about pairing practices. Complete project by lunch on Thursday, refactoring for the rest of day. Hands off Ruby methods.

**How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?**

  * Slack DM, in person, Git. initials/branch-name-#number.
  * PR: Never merge own. Tag partner in each. Meaningful comment on each before merge. All tests pass.
  * Tag Sally in major PRs
  * Solid readme.

**What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?**

  * 30 minute stall rule (come seek help). Practice asking 'revealing' questions. Not a huge concern because of pairing.

**Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?**

  * Mike's red flags: 'my baby' syndrome (attachment to work), obsessive work pattern.
  * Drew's: selective hearing (e.g., will not register ideas that are disliked or misunderstood)
